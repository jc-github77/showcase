## Background
This is a rebuilt version of BookApp, created using Firebase Studio. Except for a few icon name modifications in the source code, the entire application was generated by Firebase Studio in response to my detailed prompts.
I began by outlining the appâ€™s functionality, then progressively added features until the user interface matched my vision. Once the design was complete, I guided Firebase Studio to implement real data persistence and user authentication.
The following README was also generated by Firebase Studio, and quite honestly, it expresses the project as clearly as I could hope to.


# BiblioTech - Your Personal AI-Powered Library

BiblioTech is a modern web application designed to help you manage your personal book collection with ease. Built with a powerful and scalable tech stack, it offers intelligent features to make organizing and discovering your books a delightful experience.

## Key Features

-   **Comprehensive Library Management**: Easily add, edit, and delete books, authors, series, and categories. Track your reading progress, ownership status, and personal ratings for every book in your collection.
